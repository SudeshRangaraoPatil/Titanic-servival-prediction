This repository contains Python code for predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The script preprocesses the data, handles missing values, engineers new features, and trains various machine learning models including decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression. It evaluates the models' performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, the repository includes visualization scripts to explore the data and model performance. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning concepts and techniques applied to a real-world dataset.
